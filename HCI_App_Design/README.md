# About
- This is an app design idea called CornellLib
- Our app design idea was made on Figma 
- CornellLib is an app idea that focuses on helping students to find available seats and study spaces around Cornell
- The app's main function is to show students: how far a library is based on their location, where nearby dining options are, library seat availability, how populated the library is, the loan services available at that library, and room reservations
- The link below will take you to our interactive prototype on Figma
