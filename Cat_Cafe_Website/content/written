-"I'm very passionate about bringing cats into a better place and bringing cats and people together. I knew I didn't just want to have an adoption center for cats," she says. "I wanted a place that was a hub that people could come and feel safe and feel welcome and meet with their friends and just beam that sunshine out into the world." - Kristin
-"We have a lot of people who [say] 'I'm really stressed out, I need to sit in a room with cats," says Kristen. We had a student who was doing summer session at Cornell [and] he was here every single day." -Kristin
