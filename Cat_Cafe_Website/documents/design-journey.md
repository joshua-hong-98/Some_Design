Café# Project 4 - Design & Plan

Your Team Name: Brown Scorpion

## Milestone 1: Design your Client's Site

### Client Selection (Milestone 1)

#### Client Description

[Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?]

Our client is the Alley Cat Café located in Downtown Ithaca at 312 East Seneca Street. Kristin, the owner of Alley Cat Café, wants a website that serves both descriptive purposes and marketing purposes. Descriptive purposes to show potential customers what services the Alley Cat Café can offer. Marketing purposes to bring customers in and improve their revenue.

Key goals
- One of their key goals is to get cats to be adopted by the Ithaca community. To raise awareness of stray pets, especially cats in particular.
- Bring in potential customers and pet owners into their cat café
- Improve revenue of the café business

[NOTE: If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site. Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the Project 4 requirements.]

- We are not re-designing a website. Kristin was in the process of designing a website using the service, Wix, however when we contacted her. She was enthusiastic of working with us to expediate the process of designing her website.

### Client Needs & Wants/Requirements (Milestone 1)

#### Purpose & Content

[Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.]
- The purpose of the website is to raise awareness about adoptable cats and build a safe community where homeowners can connect with the cat community.
- To generate interest in cat café services and food products
- Provide content about cats through Mission page, adoption information page.
- Provide information about a safe space for stray cats
#### Client Needs and Wants

[Collect your client's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.]

Example:
- Needs/Wants #1
  - **Needs and Wants** [What does your client and audience need and want?]
    - Kristin (client) wants to provide general descriptive information about the Alley Cat Café services
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
    - Create web-pages and paragraph sections in html content pages
      - specifically a visit page and mission page
        these pages will provide the audience with info on what the cafe does and info on how much the cafe costs
  - **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - We should provide multiple pages presenting users with information about the cat cafe's mission and general information. Since the cafe's mission statement is so strong, it might be good to split these into different pages.

- Needs/Wants #2
  - **Needs and Wants** [What does your client and audience need and want?]
    - Kristin (client) wants to provide volunteers with information about how to get involved with the cat community in Ithaca
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
    - Create a webpage, such as volunteer.html, to provide information and requirements for how to get involved. Or for how to become a volunteer at the cat cafe. Maybe a form to get interested applicant's information?
  - **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - The form will provide Kristin with interested applicants who have a passion for volunteering for animals. A webpage will just show information.

- Needs/Wants #3
  - **Needs and Wants** [What does your client and audience need and want?]
    - Kristin (client) wants to provide users with pictures so they can have a better idea of what they are getting themselves into.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
    - We could make a page devoted to just the images
    - in order to provide a lot of images without causing clutter, we could create a slideshow with javascript interactivity so the user can scroll through
  - **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - The users will want to see what the cafe is like, especially if they have never been to such a place before.

#### Client Meeting Notes

[By this point, you have met once with your client to discuss all their requirements. Include your notes from the meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting. Include these artifacts here.]

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)

#### Target Audience(s)

[Tell us about the specific audience(s) for this website.]
The specific audience for the Alley Cat Cafe are people who are interested in visiting the cafe. These individuals interested in visiting may also be interested in volunteering or adopting the cats.

#### Target Audience Needs

[What are the needs of your target audience(s)? Note that these are probably *not* the needs of your client.]
- The target audience needs to be able to...
  - see where the cat cafe is and it's hours.
  - see the menu and it's costs
  - see pricing for going to Cafe
  - contact the owner with any questions
  - register to volunteer if interested
### Initial Design (Milestone 1)

#### Content

[Place your content in the **content** folder. NOT in the documents folder.]

[Note any content (e.g., text, image) that you need to make/get from the client here.]
- Content not made available to us by Kristin yet.
#### Content Organization, Information Architecture, and Navigation

[Lay out the plan for how you'll organize the site and which content will go where. Plan out the navigation for the site. Document your process for organizing the content.]

[Note: As with the Needs and Wants table, there is no specific amount to write here. You simply need enough content to do the job.]

Example:
- **Content** (List all the content corresponding to main navigation and sub-categories.)
  - *Portfolio*: list all the projects (as images) this client has worked on. When the image is hovered over, display a description of the project; add a search function to enable users search for specific projects;

  - *Websites*: showcase all the websites designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;

  - *Mobile Apps*: showcase all the mobile apps designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;

  - *Tablets*: showcase all the tablet applications designed by the client, with thumbnail images and a brief description for each design;

  - **Navigation**

  ![image9](cardsort.jpg)
  - [explanation of how your come up with your content organization and navigation.]
    We just decided to come up with a typical design according to suggested needs and wants by Kristin. As we are still in the developmental stage, we are still modifying designs and layouts around. Right now, we have Home, Mission, Cats, Menu, Volunteer, Adopt, Contact. Just the basic informational pages as of right now.
#### Sketches

[Include exploratory idea sketches of your website.]

#### Interactivity

[What interactive features will your site have? Describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.]

- Form for sending information to Kristin about potential interested customers
- Two forms may be used, another one for adoption information.
- Hiding of webpages about adoption information in a website dominated by cat cafe content, this will done using javascript.

#### Additional Comments (Milestone 1)

Notes taken with participant 3:
![](UserTest3.jpeg)
### Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)

- We added the address on the home page as well so users would be able to find it easier
- We could possibly also get more information from Kristin to add on the volunteer page in order for volunteers to know what they are signing up for. For now, we included a general description for which we thought it might entail - feeding and playing with the cats.

### Final Notes to the Clients (Final Submission)

[Describe in some detail what the client will do (or would have to do) in order to make this website go live. What is the deployment plan?]

In order for the client to make this website go live, they would need to purchase a domain for this to be hosted. Then the website could be uploaded through a file transfer protocol software. This would be a better option for Kristin because this site is for a business and it would not be adequate to just post it on GitHub or a different shared hosting domain.

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]

In order to keep the website relevant, it would be recommended that Kristin update the images of cats in the gallery as well as update some of the reviews in the slideshow on the first page.


### Final Notes to the Graders (Final Submission)

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]

1. Automatic slideshow of reviews on the homepage is unique and sets it apart from other websites. This automatic slideshow works well in Kristen's (owner of Alley Cat Café) favor as her yelp reviews are very good and her cat café is rated very highly. This would show potential customers that Alley Cat Café is seen very highly by fellow customers in the area, attracting more people.
2. A separate page for the Alley Cat Cafe's Mission Statement separates our cat café website from other cat café websites as it shows that the Alley Cat Café is not just a organization that uses cats to sell drinks and other food goods.  A separate page for the mission statement shows that Kristen is dedicated to helping stray and abandoned cats without a home. She is dedicated to providing them a home and she even said that she wants the Alley Cat Café to be a "lone bright spot" in the town of Ithaca.
3. Our volunteer form is also considered another strength. Other websites just ask for volunteers. However, we have set up a form where she can collect information about potential volunteers. This also allows the user to easily send information and interest to Kristen about helping the stray cat community here in Ithaca.

[2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.]
1. The gallery won't automatically update. When cats are adopted, Kristen would have to manually update those pictures by deleting cat pictures that are adopted and adding new cat pictures that are added into the Alley Cat Café.
2. We wanted to implement a blog-like page for Kristen, where she can keep interested users updated. With this page, she can keep users updated on day to day activities in the Alley Cat Café. That would be a optimization next step for us.

[3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.]
  - We believed that there were so many pages that users would be interested in, in the mobile version it would be beneficial to have a nav bar that opens and closes in order to reduce scrolling and page clutter
  - We included larger images on some of the pages, including mission, menu, and contact. This is because we believed that in order for the user to get a better understanding of what the cafe is like, they would want to see more pics of the cafe and its environment. This is important because they will be paying for the experience, and will not want to have wasted money on something they might not actually be interested in.
