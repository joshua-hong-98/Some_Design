# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.
Brown Scorpion - Brian Chen (BC596)
Brown Scorpion - Joshua Hong (JH976)
Brown Scorpion - Catherine Kwak (cik22)
Brown Scorpion - Ben Boston (brb222)

2. To what goals do we all commit?
- The MileStones are all usually due on Tuesday. We aim to have them done by Monday nights to avoid any conflict and mishaps with submissions.


3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
- Keep the group chat updated.
- Everytime you make a commit, let the Facebook group chat knows
- Everyone should try to find a client
- Aim to meet once on the weekends, and once during Monday Nights

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

- Communication will be done through the Project 4 group chat that bc596 has added us all to.
- Communication should also be done in person, meetings are tentatively scheduled for once on weekends and once on Monday Nights

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

- Depending on the client's schedule, we will either communicate with them through email, phone, or other forms of social media. Preferable form of communication will be to meet in person, however most of these small clients we are contacting put their full day's of work into their local business. This resulting in them not having as much time to meet in person to discuss the wants and needs for the website.

6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

Outreach: Find and reach out to clients and schedule meetings as well as discuss terms
Lead: Science shows that groups are usually more effective if a lead is appointed and others follow, creating a smooth hierarchy. Lead does not hold any more power than other roles by any means. The lead is just responsible for organization purposes and creating the "gameplan"
Completion: Make sure everything is properly submitted and formatted
Meeting Person: Decide where and when to meet.


7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- Assignment of roles should prevent this from happening. Confrontation of the group member will occur if a group member is not contributing up to his or her expected contributions

8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

- Any dispute between two conflicts will be bought up to the rest of the group members for a group opinion. The majority of the group that sides with whatever opinion should be the method that we decide to go with. Any further disputes will be resolved through a group modification of the contract.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

- We will revisit this contract when there is a dispute to settle disputes.
- We will also revisit this contract for clarification and assignment of roles. Roles will probably be switched or rotated to ensure fairness.  

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
- Completion of the project will be our reward!


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
