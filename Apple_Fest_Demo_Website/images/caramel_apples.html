    <h1> Prices Caramel Apples </h1>
    <p>It doesn't get much simpler than this, maybe other than just a regular apple, but
      nonetheless in sweets relating to apples, caramel apples have been a classic since
      who knows when. The caramel apples you get here are simply fantastic. The apples are nice, cold,
      and juicy while the caramel, which they stir right in front of you, is heart-meltingly warm. The
      combination is unbeatable, and to top it off, you get a toppings choice of chocolate fudge or whipcream,
      and there is no line! </p>
      <p> $5 per serving </p>
