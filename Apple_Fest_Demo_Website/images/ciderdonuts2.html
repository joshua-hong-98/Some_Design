    <h1> Prices for Cider Donuts </h1>
    <p>Although Apple Cider Donuts have been the staple of the Apple Fest, there has always been
      only one vendor selling these delicious pastery. However, this year, for the first time there
      were two vendors selling Cider Donuts, and this vendor happened to be one of them. Run by a local
      Amish group, these donuts differed from the other Cider Donuts as they were covered in smooth,
      sugary glaze. The donuts are fried right in front of you, which takes longer, but it is definitely worth
      the wait for these donuts as they are blissfully sweet. </p>
